## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- **BEM class names** like `card__image-container` and `card__creator-name` make it clear which block and element I'm styling.
- Using a consistent naming convention (`block__element--modifier`) across the project reduces confusion and enforces best practices.
